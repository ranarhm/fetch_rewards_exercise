# Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineer Coding Exercise

This repository contains my solutions for the **Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineer** coding exercise. The exercise involves:
- Reviewing unstructured JSON data.
- Designing a structured relational data model.
- Writing SQL queries to answer business questions.
- Evaluating data quality.
- Communicating results effectively with stakeholders.

## Repository Structure

- `data_model/` - Contains the data model diagrams and explanation
- `sql/` - Contains SQL queries answering business questions
- `code/` - Contains the Python script for data quality analysis
- `documentation/` - Contains the stakeholder communication

## Overview of Solution

1. **Data Model**: I've designed both an entity-relationship model and a dimensional star schema optimized for analytics queries.

2. **SQL Queries**: I've written queries to answer the following business questions:
   - Top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the most recent month
   - Comparison of average spend between receipt statuses
   - Brand with most spend among recently created users

3. **Data Quality Assessment**: I've identified several data quality issues through a Python script, including missing values, inconsistent date formats, and referential integrity problems.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: I've drafted a clear email to business stakeholders explaining findings, asking clarifying questions, and outlining next steps.

## Technologies Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Python (pandas for data analysis)
- Markdown for documentation
