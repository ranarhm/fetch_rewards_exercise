Subject: Data Quality Assessment and Proposed Data Model for Receipt Analysis

Dear Product Manager and Business Leaders,

I've completed the initial analysis of our receipt, user, and brand data. I wanted to share a summary of my findings, proposed data model, and some questions that would help us optimize our analytics platform.

Data Model Overview:
I've designed a dimensional star schema optimized for analytics queries, with fact tables for receipts and receipt items, linked to dimension tables for users, brands, and dates. This structure will allow us to efficiently analyze receipt trends, brand performance, and user behavior.

Key Insights Available:
- Top brands by receipt volume
- Receipt acceptance trends
- User spending patterns by brand
- New user engagement metrics

Data Quality Concerns:
During my analysis, I discovered several data quality issues that need attention:

1. Approximately 8% of receipts have missing purchase dates, which impacts our ability to do time-based analysis
2. There are inconsistent date formats across different date fields
3. We have receipts referencing users who don't exist in our user database
4. Some receipts show negative values for points and total spent

Questions for Your Team:
1. What is the business definition of an "accepted" vs. "rejected" receipt? Are there specific validation rules?
2. How should we handle receipts with missing purchase dates? Should we use scan date as a fallback?
3. For users with missing state information, should we exclude them from geographic analysis or attempt to infer location?
4. What is the expected time range between purchase date and scan date? I've noticed some outliers.

Next Steps:
Based on your input, I'll implement data quality rules in our pipeline and refine the data model as needed. I recommend we set up automated monitoring for these data quality issues to ensure our analytics remain reliable.

Performance Considerations:
For production, I'm planning to implement the following optimizations:
- Partitioning receipt data by month to improve query performance
- Creating aggregation tables for common metrics to reduce computation time
- Implementing incremental data loads to minimize processing time

I'd be happy to discuss these findings in more detail. Would you have time for a quick call later this week?

Thank you,
